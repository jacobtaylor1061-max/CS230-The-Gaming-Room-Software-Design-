# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

# The Gaming Room was a client who tasked us with addressing their software needs for their game "Draw It, or Lose It." The game is based on the TV show "Win, Lose, or Draw." "Draw It or Lose It" is a game in which multiple teams compete to guess the displayed image as the timer ticks down. For this, our client, The Gaming Room, would like their game to support multiple teams and players with unique IDs in a web-based application where teams can compete to guess a picture from a library of drawings. The software neededto be designed required a comprehensive application that could handle unique user, team, and game IDs, be web-based, and maintain a single instance of each game in memory. Further, the Gaming Room required the game to be accessible across multiple device types while remaining highly scalable. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

# I excelled at listing my client's needs in the executive summary by providing a rundown of what they required for their game to be accessed by a much larger customer base. I clearly communicated the requirements, design constraints, system architecture view, domain model, and evaluation, all of which were presented concisely. I paid close attention to detail, making sure I presented the full scope of each point while also promoting the need for a seamless user experience to be at the forefront of software development. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

# The documentation helped me approach code development by providing a structured framework to reference and work from. Essentially, the software development document served as a blueprint for developing the code in the quickest, most efficient way possible.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# If I were to pick a section to revise, I would start with the Development Requirements portion of the document. While the structure is fairly easy to view and understand, I found it difficult to fully discuss the requirements for the client and server side, as well as the development tools for each operating system. Most of what I was trying to communicate felt too shallow and did not convey the point I was trying to make. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# The Gaming Room's requirements for their user's needs were clear. They wanted the user to have a seamless experience and the most options available for unique IDs. Knowing this, it was easy to design the software to accommodate the user. Asking myself, "How would I react if I were the user?" helped me design the software so each user experience was seamless. Developing the application to be efficient with both memory and storage while also remaining secure helped me to protect that seamless experience for the intended user. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

# While approaching the software design, I focused on breaking it into parts rather than diving headfirst into the code. Doing this helped me maintain my workload while also building a suitable application that met the client's needs. From this course, I learned that UML diagrams are an incredibly useful tool for analyzing and designing software applications. Knowing this, I will continue to use UML diagrams to begin designing an application.
